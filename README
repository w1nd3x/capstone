First Installation:
1. Once you've downloaded the source, hopefully using git, run the build script.
2. That is all.

# process over a set of days 
./run -anchor "anchor" -start "YYYYMMDD" -end "YYYYMMDD" 

# train a new model on a set of labeled tweets 
./run -train

# test a model against a test set of labeled tweets
