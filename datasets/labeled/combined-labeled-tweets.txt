negative	Just watched From Paris with Love. Dumb move on my part. How that movie got green lit is beyond me.
negative	Clash of the Titans. Bad remake, bad mythology. Bleh.
negative	saw 'Shutter Island' this weekend... and it was horrible.... but maybe because i was sleepy.. ;-)
negative	Just been to see the bounty hunter!!! Seriously @username  what were you thinking iv just paid √Ç¬£6.45 I want a refund please
negative	Btw I saw #wolfman yesterday and it sucked
negative	Last night I say the movie #wolfman and to be honest I don't know if I could recomend this movie. Not what I expected!!!
negative	From Paris with love is a terrible movie.. Lol
negative	Writing up a review of Legion. Sneak preview: it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Possibly the worst. Like, Transformers 2 bad.
negative	@username I heard about Dear John... Kind of glad I didn't waste $9.25!
negative	I hated 'Edge of Darkness' &amp; 'The Wolfman'. I think i'm done with multiplex cinemas. Majority of the movies no longer appeal to me.
negative	From Paris With Love: *** Dull average dumb action film saved by a scenery chewing Travolta.
negative	@username Smith is whining about critics seeing films for free.  It shouldn't and doesn't matter, really.  Cop Out is still awful.
negative	Legion: not good. Especially when half the chairs in your theater are covered with trash bags, and you just heard rumors of bedbugs. Eep.
negative	@username Even if I saw &quot;Shutter Island&quot; with free passes, I would demand my money back!
negative	@username I saw Legion yesterday. It sucked :( No plot and no angels in trench coats xD

negative	shutter island ....  DISAPPOINTMENT.  but  im  tough  on  movies...  it  wasn't  all  bad.. ehh  I  don't  want  to  ruin  it..  lol.
negative	Alice in wonderland wasn't so great. They shud have just done the movie about the first time she was there.....
negative	Verdict about Edge of Darkness: Two thumbs WAY down.
negative	Dis movie legion a fool!
negative	So frustrated with this movie LEGION, ugh!!!!
negative	Okay: so I know this may not be a popular view, but I really didn't like Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland (and I love Tim Burton).
negative	From Paris with love is so LAME ;/
negative	Saw 'Ghost Writer' today. Was thoroughly confused the entire time.
negative	The Book of Eli wit Denzel Washington sucked_a bunch of barbaric aka uncivilized nonsense

negative	Watching the tooth fairy, its quite rubbish :)
negative	WOLFMAN was one of The worst movies I done see in awhile. A waste of Atlantic station trip lol
negative	Alice in Wonderland is anything but spectacular....just a revival of a childhood's book...

negative	@username For sure. I was more looking for something to break up the snow days. Thank God I was saved from having to see Tooth Fairy!
negative	I saw Wolfman last night. What a terribly mediocre movie.
negative	The Wedesnday production of ALICE IN WONDERLAND is unwatchable. But the 1903 silent version is pretty cool. #kevinwb
negative	Ok, the Tooth Fairy was lame. Kids will love it. Adults won't. At least Ashley Judd was n it :) Rock was good but movie was a cheese fest
negative	Had a fantastic long date tonight with @username: saw H.M.S. Pinafore, had steak and ribs for dinner, and saw an awful movie (Legion).
negative	Shutter Island was a #lowblow. Not what I expected.
negative	RT @username: Martin Scorsese took a dump and named it Shutter Island. Voila.
negative	not too impressed with The Wolfman.  I all-star cast but the plot never really came together for me.
negative	Just got back from watching The Wolfman. That movie SUCKED! Severely disappointed.
negative	Saw Alice in Wonderland last night I give it 4/10!!!
negative	clash of the titans sucked ass D: I'm so dissapointed.
negative	@username my head hurts from Shutter Island
negative	Edge of Darkness 3/10 i want my money back!!!
negative	Disappointed by Legion. It was better if this flick just stayed as trailer

negative	Shutter Island is a fucked up movie.
negative	@username You werent there!!! ={ we watched BOUNTY HUNTER...it sucked, it was long, boring, Nelly looked like she was bout to fall asleep =}
negative	went to see alice in wonderland tonight.. verdict: average. very very overated
negative	Wolfman was...gross. I thought it was PG-13 and it was actually R. And Benico Del Toro cannot carry a movie by himself.
negative	ok #FYI that movie *THE CRAZIES* suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucks dick... what the fuck... ended so stupid...
negative	I didn't enjoy Alice In Wonderland (snoozefest, literally) but I actually really like Avril Levigne's song &quot;Alice&quot; she wrote as the theme...
negative	Lmao we saw when in rome and drew and I got bored so we snuck out and went shopping and got back right on time &amp; nobody even noticed √É≈ì___√É≈ì
negative	chilled out Sunday. Saw wolfman. Boringly scary. Ate at New York New York. It wasn't the same! :(
negative	The Wolfman was a terrible movie
negative	&quot;Legion&quot; looks a little over the top, but I do like Adrianne Palicki... we will see
negative	I really want my ticket money back. #Wolfman was some bullshit! That movie had so much potential and they just made some bullshit.
negative	@username max has to see Alice in wonderland for extra credit for school the movie looks too dark! He really doesn't want to see it!
negative	@username I thought &quot;Shutter Island&quot; was pretty crappy.  Not scary, creepy or innovative.  Mildly entertaining is my verdict.
